# What is this?

An isometric demo done in PIXI.js;

# TODO
* Bound character to terrain.
* Pathfinding without obstacles (click to move)
* Add obstacles (like the player, a wall maybe)
* AI - go to player.
* Char order - Move pivot to bottom?

## Notes/Thoughts
* Will need an arr of all objects when doing pathfinding?
* What about render order, if we have more stuff on the screen?
